Score,Criteria and Implications
3A,No component of BC or EF is unreliable or unlikely for any year.
3B,No component of BC or EF is unreliable or unlikely for the latest data year. Some individual components of the EF or BC are unlikely in the latest data year. The total EF and BC time series results are not significantly affected by unlikely data.
3C,"No component of BC or EF is unreliable or unlikely for the years prior to the latest data year. Some individual components of the EF or BC are unlikely in the latest year. Total EF and BC values are unlikely or unreliable in the most recent data year, but the ability to ascribe creditor/debtor status is unaffected in latest year."
3D,"No component of BC or EF is unreliable or unlikely for the years prior to the latest data year. Some components of the EF or BC are very unlikely in the latest year. EF and BC results in the latest year are significantly impacted by the unlikely or unreliable values, making them unusable."
2A,"EF or BC component time series have results that are very unreliable or very unlikely, except in the latest data year. The total EF and BC time series results are not significantly affected by unlikely data. No EF and BC results in the latest year are significantly affected by unlikely data."
2B,"EF or BC component time series have results that are very unreliable or very unlikely, including the latest year. The total EF and BC time series results are not significantly affected by unlikely data."
2C,"Total EF or BC time series and component EF and BC time series results are unreliable or unlikely, especially in the latest year. The total EF and BC time series results are not significantly affected by unlikely data. The unlikely or unreliable values have most likely not impacted the creditor/debtor status in the latest year."
2D,"Total EF or BC time series and component EF and BC time series results are unreliable or unlikely, especially in the latest year. The total EF and BC time series results are not significantly affected by unlikely data. EF and BC results in the latest year are significantly impacted by the unlikely or unreliable values, making them unusable."
1A,"Several components of the EF or BC are very unreliable or unlikely, except the latest year. The EF and BC time series results are significantly affected by unlikely data, and are unusable. No EF and BC results in the latest year are significantly affected by unlikely data."
1B,"Several components of the EF or BC are very unreliable or unlikely, except the latest year. The EF and BC time series results are significantly affected by unlikely data, and are unusable. The total EF and BC results in the latest year are not significantly affected by unlikely data."
1C,"Several components of the EF or BC are very unreliable or unlikely. The EF and BC time series results are significantly affected by unlikely data, and are unusable. The unlikely or unreliable values have not impacted the creditor/debtor status."
1D,There is too much unreliable or unlikely data to make any conclusions about the timeline or latest year of this country.
