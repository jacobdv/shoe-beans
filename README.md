### Data Sources
##### NFA 2019 National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts data set (1961-2016) (https://data.world/footprint/nfa-2019-edition)
##### United Nations Development Program: Human Development Reports (http://hdr.undp.org/en/data)

### Project Proposal 
We'll be creating a database from United Nations data and National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts that describe a country's environmental footprint. We will be merging this data on country name. 

##### Considerations
Our environmental data includes a reliability 'QScore' and while we would ideally like to include only the best data, selecting only the data with the highest reliability, 3A, this removes 58 countries from our data, though it does leave us with 51,000 of our original 72,000 rows of data from this source.
